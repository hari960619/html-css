Absolute Lengths : The absolute length units are fixed and a length expressed in any of these will appear as exactly that size.

Absolute length units are not recommended for use on screen, because screen sizes vary so much. However, they can be used if the output medium is known, such as for print layout.

   Unit	                Description
    cm	        centimeters
    mm	        millimeters
    in	        inches (1in = 96px = 2.54cm)
    px  	    pixels (1px = 1/96th of 1in)
    pt	        points (1pt = 1/72 of 1in)
    pc	        picas (1pc = 12 pt)

Relative Lengths : Relative length units specify a length relative to another length property. Relative length units scale better between different rendering mediums.

   Unit	                            Description	
    em	        Relative to the font-size of the element (2em means 2 times the size of the current font)	
    rem	        Relative to font-size of the root element	
    vw	        Relative to 1% of the width of the viewport*	
    vh	        Relative to 1% of the height of the viewport*	
   vmin	        Relative to 1% of viewport's* smaller dimension	
   vmax	        Relative to 1% of viewport's* larger dimension	
    %	        Relative to the parent element

    ex	        Relative to the x-height of the current font (rarely used)	
    ch	        Relative to width of the "0" (zero)
