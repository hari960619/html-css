HTML Images Syntax: 
The HTML <img> tag is used to embed an image in a web page.

Images are not technically inserted into a web page; images are linked to web pages. 
The <img> tag creates a holding space for the referenced image.
The <img> tag is empty, it contains attributes only, and does not have a closing tag.
The <img> tag has two required attributes:

src - Specifies the path to the image.
alt - Specifies an alternate text for the image.

There are two ways to specify the URL in the src attribute:

        1. Absolute URL - Links to an external image that is hosted on another website. Example: src="https://www.w3schools.com/images/img_girl.jpg".
                Notes: External images might be under copyright. 
                If you do not get permission to use it, you may be in violation of copyright laws. 
                In addition, you cannot control external images; it can suddenly be removed or changed.

        2. Relative URL - Links to an image that is hosted within the website. Here, the URL does not include the domain name. 
                If the URL begins without a slash, it will be relative to the current page. Example: src="img_girl.jpg". 
                If the URL begins with a slash, it will be relative to the domain. 
                Example: src="/images/img_girl.jpg".
