Chapter Summary: 
    Use the <a> element to define a link
    Use the href attribute to define the link address
    Use the target attribute to define where to open the linked document
    Use the <img> element (inside <a>) to use an image as a link
    Use the mailto: scheme inside the href attribute to create a link that opens the user's email program

<a href="url">link text</a>

    The most important attribute of the <a> element is the href attribute, which indicates the link's destination.
    The link text is the part that will be visible to the reader.
    Clicking on the link text, will send the reader to the specified URL address.

<a href="https://www.w3schools.com/">Visit W3Schools.com!</a>

By default, links will appear as follows in all browsers:

An unvisited link is underlined and blue
A visited link is underlined and purple
An active link is underlined and red

HTML Links - The target Attribute
    By default, the linked page will be displayed in the current browser window. To change this, you must specify another target for the link.
    The target attribute specifies where to open the linked document.
    The target attribute can have one of the following values:

        1) _self - Default. Opens the document in the same window/tab as it was clicked
        2) _blank - Opens the document in a new window or tab

Example: 
        Use target="_blank" to open the linked document in a new browser window or tab:
        <a href="https://www.w3schools.com/" target="_blank">Visit W3Schools!</a>

Absolute URLs vs. Relative URLs
Both examples above are using an absolute URL (a full web address) in the href attribute.
A local link (a link to a page within the same website) is specified with a relative URL (without the "https://www" part):

Example
<h2>Absolute URLs</h2>
<p><a href="https://www.w3.org/">W3C</a></p>
<p><a href="https://www.google.com/">Google</a></p>

<h2>Relative URLs</h2>
<p><a href="html_images.asp">HTML Images</a></p>
<p><a href="/css/default.asp">CSS Tutorial</a></p>

Link to an Email Address
    Use mailto: inside the href attribute to create a link that opens the user's email program (to let them send a new email):

        Example: <a href="mailto:someone@example.com">Send email</a>
