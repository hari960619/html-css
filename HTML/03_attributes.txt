HTML Attributes
    All HTML elements can have attributes.
    Attributes provide additional information about elements.
    Attributes are always specified in the start tag.
    Attributes usually come in name/value pairs like: name="value".

Chapter Summary: 
        All HTML elements can have attributes
        The href attribute of <a> specifies the URL of the page the link goes to
        The src attribute of <img> specifies the path to the image to be displayed
        The width and height attributes of <img> provide size information for images
        The alt attribute of <img> provides an alternate text for an image
        The style attribute is used to add styles to an element, such as color, font, size, and more
        The lang attribute of the <html> tag declares the language of the Web page
        The title attribute defines some extra information about an element

1) The href Attribute: 
    The <a> tag defines a hyperlink. The href attribute specifies the URL of the page the link goes to: 
        Example:
                <a href="https://www.w3schools.com">Visit W3Schools</a>

2) The src Attribute:
    The <img> tag is used to embed an image in an HTML page. The src attribute specifies the path to the image to be displayed:
        Example:
                <img src="img_girl.jpg">

There are two ways to specify the URL in the src attribute:

        1. Absolute URL - Links to an external image that is hosted on another website. Example: src="https://www.w3schools.com/images/img_girl.jpg".
                Notes: External images might be under copyright. 
                If you do not get permission to use it, you may be in violation of copyright laws. 
                In addition, you cannot control external images; it can suddenly be removed or changed.

        2. Relative URL - Links to an image that is hosted within the website. Here, the URL does not include the domain name. 
                If the URL begins without a slash, it will be relative to the current page. Example: src="img_girl.jpg". 
                If the URL begins with a slash, it will be relative to the domain. 
                Example: src="/images/img_girl.jpg".

Tip: It is almost always best to use relative URLs. They will not break if you change domain.

3) The width and height Attributes:
    The <img> tag should also contain the width and height attributes, which specify the width and height of the image (in pixels):
        Example: 
                <img src="img_girl.jpg" width="500" height="600">

4) The style Attribute:
    The style attribute is used to add styles to an element, such as color, font, size, and more.
        Example:
                <p style="color:red;">This is a red paragraph.</p>

5)The title Attribute:
    The title attribute defines some extra information about an element.
        The value of the title attribute will be displayed as a tooltip when you mouse over the element:
        Example: 
                <p title="I'm a tooltip">This is a paragraph.</p>
